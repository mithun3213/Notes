## COMMANDS OF THE GDB:

gdb ./program
run
run [args]
start
break <func> / b <func>
info break
delete <num>
disable <num>
enable <num>
finish
display <expr>
info args
  

-->gdb./program:
this command is used to run the executable file called program.....

-->run :
this commands is used to run the file until the breakpoint is set 
who to set the breakpoint is that gdb : break main
it will set the breakpoint to main that means it will execute the until the main fun arises
gdb : break file:30
the above commands is used to break the file at line number 30

--->start:
this command is used to set the breakpoint at the first line of the main , and then runs until the first line of the main func

-->break <func> / b <func>:
This command sets a **breakpoint** at the **start of a function**.

When your program hits that function during execution, GDB will **pause** automatically so you can inspect what's happening.

-->info break:
it is used to see the information of the break point 

--> x/<count><format><size> <address>:

Examine the contents of memory at a given address, in various formats (hex, decimal, string, etc).

-->count   How many units to print (e.g., 4 = show 4 values)

-->format     Format to display the data in (hex, dec, ascii...)

-->size   Size of each memory unit (byte, word, etc.)

-->address  Starting memory address to examine|

-->Format Characters:
x  Hexadecimal
d  Signed decimal
u  Unsigned decimal
o  Octal
t  Binary
f  Floating point
c Character (ASCII)
s String
i Instruction (disassemble)

-->Size Characters:
b Byte (1 byte)
	
h Halfword (2 bytes)

w  Word (4 bytes)

g  Giant word (8 bytes)


-->View 4 words in hex:

(gdb) x/4xw 0x601050

-->Show a string:

(gdb) x/s 0x601060

-->View 2 signed integers:

(gdb) x/2dw 0x601050

-->View memory as ASCII characters:
(gdb) x/6cb 0x601070

-->(gdb) list
This shows 10 lines around the current point.

-->to get the memory address --> p &x(variable_name)

--> to set the break of the func we will use break greet (func_name)
to get the address of the variable we will use gdb: p &x (here x is the variable_name)
in case we need to get the address of the function like greet we will use :-->info address greet or func_name:

tools:
static:
ghidra 
IDA free
Radare 2
for dynamic 
GDB 
x64dbg
strace/ltrace


------->to see the security protection for the file we ca use the (((checksec --file=file_name)))


-----> rabin2 same as the exiftool in the forencis some more advanced detailed about the file like architecture 


---> pidof file_name this will return the process id of the file 
----> cat /proc/pid_num/maps will return the address of the file , while the first one is the base address
