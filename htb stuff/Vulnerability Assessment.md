   
## Vulnerability Assessment:

A vulnerability assessment can be based on various security standards. Which standards apply to a particular network will depend on many factors. These factors can include industry-specific and regional data security regulations, the size and form of a company's network, which types of applications they use or develop, and their security maturity level.

Vulnerability assessments may be performed independently or alongside other security assessments depending on an organization's situation.

They're called penetration tests because testers conduct them to determine if and how they can penetrate a network. A pentest is a type of simulated cyber attack, and pentesters conduct actions that a threat actor may perform to see if certain kinds of exploits are possible. The key difference between a pentest and an actual cyber attack is that the former is done with the full legal consent of the entity being pentested. Whether a pentester is an employee or a third-party contractor, they will need to sign a lengthy legal document with the target company that describes what they're allowed to do and what they're not allowed to do.

`Black box` pentesting is done with no knowledge of a network's configuration or applications. Typically a tester will either be given network access (or an ethernet port and have to bypass Network Access Control NAC) and nothing else (requiring them to perform their own discovery for IP addresses) if the pentest is internal, or nothing more than the company name if the pentest is from an external standpoint. This type of pentesting is usually conducted by third parties from the perspective of an `external` attacker. Often the customer will ask the pentester to show them discovered internal/external IP addresses/network ranges so they can confirm ownership and note down any hosts that should be considered out-of-scope.

`Grey box` pentesting is done with a little bit of knowledge of the network they're testing, from a perspective equivalent to an `employee` who doesn't work in the IT department, such as a `receptionist` or `customer service agent`. The customer will typically give the tester in-scope network ranges or individual IP addresses in a grey box situation.

`White box` pentesting is typically conducted by giving the penetration tester full access to all systems, configurations, build documents, etc., and source code if web applications are in-scope. The goal here is to discover as many flaws as possible that would be difficult or impossible to discover blindly in a reasonable amount of time.

`Application` pentesters assess web applications, thick-client applications, APIs, and mobile applications. They will often be well-versed in source code review and able to assess a given web application from a black box or white box standpoint (typically a secure code review).

`Network` or `infrastructure` pentesters assess all aspects of a computer network, including its `networking devices` such as routers and firewalls, workstations, servers, and applications. These types of penetration testers typically must have a strong understanding of networking, Windows, Linux, Active Directory, and at least one scripting language. Network vulnerability scanners, such as `Nessus`, can be used alongside other tools during network pentesting, but network vulnerability scanning is only a part of a proper pentest. It's important to note that there are different types of pentests (evasive, non-evasive, hybrid evasive). A scanner such as Nessus would only be used during a non-evasive pentest whose goal is to find as many flaws in the network as possible. Also, vulnerability scanning would only be a small part of this type of penetration test. Vulnerability scanners are helpful but limited and cannot replace the human touch and other tools and techniques.

### What is the Red Team?

The **Red Team** is an ethical hacking team that acts like a **real-world threat actor** (e.g., a hacker group or advanced persistent threat). Their goal is **not just to find vulnerabilities**, but to **exploit them stealthily** to achieve specific objectives—like stealing sensitive data or gaining control over systems—without being detected.

---

### 🛡️ Who is the Blue Team?

The **Blue Team** is the defensive security team of the organization, responsible for detecting, responding to, and stopping attacks. A Red Team Assessment helps test how well the Blue Team can defend against realistic threats.

#### Purple Team Assessment

A `blue team` consists of defensive security specialists. These are often people who work in a SOC (security operations center) or a CSIRT (computer security incident response team). Often, they have experience with digital forensics too. So if blue teams are defensive and red teams are offensive, red mixed with blue is purple.

# Vulnerability Assessment :

The purpose of a `Vulnerability Assessment` is to understand, identify, and categorize the risk for the more apparent issues present in an environment without actually exploiting them to gain further access


### 🔎 1. **Conduct Risk Identification and Analysis**

**Purpose:** Understand what assets (hardware, software, systems) exist and what risks they might face.

**What You Do:**

- Create a complete inventory of IT assets.
    
- Identify potential threats for each asset.
    
- Assess the likelihood and impact of each risk.
    

**Why It Matters:** Helps prioritize which systems are most critical and need the most protection.

### 📋 2. **Develop Vulnerability Scanning Policies**

**Purpose:** Define the rules and responsibilities for conducting vulnerability assessments.

**What You Do:**

- Write a formal policy covering when, how, and by whom scans are done.
    
- Assign ownership of the process.
    
- Get approval from upper management.
    

**Why It Matters:** Ensures consistency, accountability, and approval across the organization.

### 🧪 3. **Identify the Type of Scans**

**Purpose:** Choose the right kind of scan for the system or application.

**Types of Scans Include:**

- **Network scans:** For routers, switches, firewalls, etc.
    
- **Host scans:** For individual devices or servers.
    
- **Wireless scans:** For Wi-Fi networks and access points.
    
- **Application scans:** For web or software apps.
    

**Why It Matters:** The effectiveness of the scan depends on matching the right scan to the right system.

### ⚙️ 4. **Configure the Scan**

**Purpose:** Set up the scan to match your network environment.

**Configuration Tasks:**

- Define **target IPs or hostnames**.
    
- Set **port ranges** and **protocols** (e.g., TCP, UDP).
    
- Choose **scan intensity**, **scheduling**, and **notification** settings.
    

**Why It Matters:** Improper configuration can miss vulnerabilities or crash systems.

### 🚀 5. **Perform the Scan**

**Purpose:** Use tools (like Nessus, OpenVAS, or Nmap) to run the actual scan.

**What Happens:**

- The tool fingerprints the system (learns what it is).
    
- It checks for **open ports**, **running services**, **OS versions**, and known vulnerabilities.
    

**Why It Matters:** This step collects the core data you’ll analyze and act on.

### ⚠️ 6. **Evaluate and Consider Possible Risks**

**Purpose:** Understand the impact of scanning itself.

**Risks Include:**

- **Overloading systems** with scan traffic.
    
- **Triggering alerts or crashes** on fragile systems.
    

**Why It Matters:** You don't want to take systems offline unintentionally during scanning

### 📊 7. **Interpret the Scan Results**

**Purpose:** Analyze the scan output and prioritize issues.

**What You Look For:**

- Vulnerabilities with **known exploits** (e.g., CVEs).
    
- Issues that are **easy to fix** or **pose high risk**.
    

**Why It Matters:** Helps you fix the most dangerous issues first (triage).

### 🛠️ 8. **Create a Remediation & Mitigation Plan**

**Purpose:** Plan and execute the fixing of discovered vulnerabilities.

**Steps Involved:**

- Work with IT/security teams to patch or fix issues.
    
- Set timelines and assign responsibilities.
    
- Document and track mitigation efforts.
    

**Why It Matters:** The goal is not just to find vulnerabilities, but to **resolve them** efficiently.

#### Vulnerability

A `Vulnerability` is a weakness or bug in an organization's environment, including applications, networks, and infrastructure, that opens up the possibility of threats from external actors. Vulnerabilities can be registered through MITRE's [Common Vulnerability Exposure database](https://cve.mitre.org/) and receive a [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator) score to determine severity. This scoring system is frequently used as a standard for companies and governments looking to calculate accurate and consistent severity scores for their systems' vulnerabilities. Scoring vulnerabilities in this way helps prioritize resources and determine how to respond to a given threat.

### **What is a Threat in Cybersecurity?**

A **threat** is something that can potentially **cause harm** to your systems, data, or organization.
In the context of this explanation

This means a **threat is not just a thing**—it's often an **action, behavior, or condition** that **increases the chances** of a security incident happening.

#### Exploit

An `Exploit` is any code or resources that can be used to take advantage of an asset's weakness. Many exploits are available through open-source platforms such as [Exploit-db](https://exploit-db.com/) or [the Rapid7 Vulnerability and Exploit Database](https://www.rapid7.com/db/). We will often see exploit code hosted on sites such as GitHub and GitLab as well

## Compliance Standards

Each regulatory compliance body has its own information security standards that organizations must adhere to maintain their accreditation. The big compliance players in information security are `PCI`, `HIPAA`, `FISMA`, and `ISO 27001`.

#### Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

The [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/) is a commonly known standard in information security that implements requirements for organizations that handle credit cards. While not a government regulation, organizations that store, process, or transmit cardholder data must still implement PCI DSS guidelines. This would include banks or online stores that handle their own payment solutions (e.g., Amazon).

PCI DSS requirements include internal and external scanning of assets. For example, any credit card data that is being processed or transmitted must be done in a Cardholder Data Environment (CDE). The CDE environment must be adequately segmented from normal assets. CDE environments are segmented off from an organization's regular environment to protect any cardholder data from being compromised during an attack and limit internal access to data.

#### Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

`HIPAA` is the [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act](https://www.hhs.gov/programs/hipaa/index.html), which is used to protect patients' data. HIPAA does not necessarily require vulnerability scans or assessments; however, a risk assessment and vulnerability identification are required to maintain HIPAA accreditation.

### Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)

The [Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)](https://www.cisa.gov/federal-information-security-modernization-act) is a set of standards and guidelines used to safeguard government operations and information. The act requires an organization to provide documentation and proof of a vulnerability management program to maintain information technology systems' proper availability, confidentiality, and integrity.

#### ISO 27001

`ISO 27001` is a standard used worldwide to manage information security. [ISO 27001](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html) requires organizations to perform quarterly external and internal scans.

Although compliance is essential, it should not drive a vulnerability management program. Vulnerability management should consider the uniqueness of an environment and the associated risk appetite to an organization.

## Penetration Testing Standards:

#### PTES

The [Penetration Testing Execution Standard](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page) (`PTES`) can be applied to all types of penetration tests. It outlines the phases of a penetration test and how they should be conducted. These are the sections in the PTES:

- Pre-engagement Interactions
- Intelligence Gathering
- Threat Modeling
- Vulnerability Analysis
- Exploitation
- Post Exploitation
- Reporting

#### OSSTMM

`OSSTMM` is the `Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual`, another set of guidelines pentesters can use to ensure they're doing their jobs properly. It can be used alongside other pentest standards.

[OSSTMM](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf) is divided into five different channels for five different areas of pentesting:

1. Human Security (human beings are subject to social engineering exploits)
2. Physical Security
3. Wireless Communications (including but not limited to technologies like WiFi and Bluetooth)
4. Telecommunications
5. Data Networks

#### NIST

The `NIST` (`National Institute of Standards and Technology`) is well known for their [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), a system for designing incident response policies and procedures. NIST also has a Penetration Testing Framework. The phases of the NIST framework include:

- Planning
- Discovery
- Attack
- Reporting

#### OWASP

`OWASP` stands for the [Open Web Application Security Project](https://owasp.org/). They're typically the go-to organization for defining testing standards and classifying risks to web applications.

OWASP maintains a few different standards and helpful guides for assessing various technologies:

- [Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/)
- [Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-security-testing-guide/)
- [Firmware Security Testing Methodology](https://github.com/scriptingxss/owasp-fstm)

# Vulnerability Scanning Overview

---

As discussed earlier, vulnerability scanning is performed to identify potential vulnerabilities in network devices such as routers, firewalls, switches, as well as servers, workstations, and applications. Scanning is automated and focuses on finding potential/known vulnerabilities on the network or at the application level. `Vulnerabilities scanners typically do not exploit vulnerabilities (with some exceptions) but need a human to manually validate scan issues` to determine whether or not a particular scan returned real issues that need to be fixed or false positives that can be ignored and excluded from future scans against the same target.


The type of scans run varies from one tool to another, but most tools `run a combination of dynamic and static tests`, depending on the target and the vulnerability. A `static test` would determine a vulnerability if the identified version of a particular asset has a public CVE. However, this is not always accurate as a patch may have been applied, or the target isn't specifically vulnerable to that CVE. On the other hand, a `dynamic test` tries specific (usually benign) payloads such as weak credentials, SQL injection, or command injection on the target (i.e., a web application). If any payload returns a hit, then there's a good chance that it is vulnerable.

## **Nessus:

**Nessus** is one of the most widely used **vulnerability scanning tools** in cybersecurity. It helps identify security issues in systems, applications, and networks by scanning for known vulnerabilities.

---

## ✅ **What Nessus Does**

Nessus performs **automated security scanning** to find:

- 🔓 **Software vulnerabilities** (e.g., CVEs)
    
- ⚙️ **Misconfigurations** in servers, databases, etc.
    
- 🛠️ **Outdated software versions**
    
- 🔐 **Weak passwords** and **default credentials**
    
- 🌐 **Open ports and insecure services**
    

---

## 🧠 **How Nessus Works – Step-by-Step**

1. ### 🔗 **Asset Discovery**
    
    - Nessus first identifies **live hosts** on a network using ping or port scans.
        
2. ### 🔍 **Enumeration**
    
    - It collects **system info** such as:
        
        - OS version
            
        - Open ports
            
        - Running services
            
        - Installed software
            
3. ### 💣 **Vulnerability Detection**
    
    - Nessus compares the discovered data against a massive **vulnerability database** (updated regularly) to check for:
        
        - Known software flaws (e.g., Apache CVE-2021-41773)
            
        - Bad configurations (e.g., public S3 buckets, weak SSL)
            
        - Default passwords
            
4. ### 📊 **Reporting**
    
    - Nessus creates detailed reports:
        
        - Vulnerability name and severity (Low/Med/High/Critical)
            
        - Affected IPs
            
        - Proof of detection
            
        - Remediation steps
