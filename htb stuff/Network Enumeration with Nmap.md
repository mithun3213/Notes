## What is enumeration ?

Enumeration is an **active information-gathering** phase where attackers or penetration testers **query services and systems** to collect data like usernames, shares, network resources, and more.

### **What Attackers Look for During Enumeration**

1. **Usernames**
2. **Group names**
3. **Shares (files/folders)**
4. **Network resources and devices**
5. **Service banners**
6. **Software versions**
7. **Open ports and running services**

Most of the ways we can get access we can narrow down to the following two points:

- `Functions and/or resources that allow us to interact with the target and/or provide additional information.`

- `Information that provides us with even more important information to access our target.`

# Introduction to Nmap


Network Mapper (`Nmap`) is an open-source network analysis and security auditing tool written in C, C++, Python, and Lua. It is designed to scan networks and identify which hosts are available on the network using raw packets, and services and applications, including the name and version, where possible. It can also identify the operating systems and versions of these hosts. Besides other features, Nmap also offers scanning capabilities that can determine if packet filters, firewalls, or intrusion detection systems (IDS) are configured as needed.

## Use Cases

The tool is one of the most used tools by network administrators and IT security specialists. It is used to:

- Audit the security aspects of networks
- Simulate penetration tests
- Check firewall and IDS settings and configurations
- Types of possible connections
- Network mapping
- Response analysis
- Identify open ports
- Vulnerability assessment as well.

## Nmap Architecture

Nmap offers many different types of scans that can be used to obtain various results about our targets. Basically, Nmap can be divided into the following scanning techniques:

- Host discovery
- Port scanning
- Service enumeration and detection
- OS detection
- Scriptable interaction with the target service (Nmap Scripting Engine)

## Syntax

The syntax for Nmap is fairly simple and looks like this:

  Introduction to Nmap

```shell-session
0xM4llc10u5@htb[/htb]$ nmap <scan types> <options> <target>
```

- If our target sends a `SYN-ACK` flagged packet back to us, Nmap detects that the port is `open`.
- If the target responds with an `RST` flagged packet, it is an indicator that the port is `closed`.
- If Nmap does not receive a packet back, it will display it as `filtered`. Depending on the firewall configuration, certain packets may be dropped or ignored by the firewall.

#### Scan Network Range

  Host Discovery

```shell-session
0xM4llc10u5@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -sn -oA tnet | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

10.129.2.4
10.129.2.10
10.129.2.11
10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
10.129.2.28
```

|`-oA tnet`|Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'tnet'.|
|`-iL`|Performs defined scans against targets in provided 'hosts.lst' list.|

## Scan Multiple IPs

It can also happen that we only need to scan a small part of a network. An alternative to the method we used last time is to specify multiple IP addresses.

  Host Discovery

```shell-session
0xM4llc10u5@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet 10.129.2.18 10.129.2.19 10.129.2.20| grep for | cut -d" " -f5

10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
```

## Scan Single IP

Before we scan a single host for open ports and its services, we first have to determine if it is alive or not. For this, we can use the same method as before.

# Host and Port Scanning

---

It is essential to understand how the tool we use works and how it performs and processes the different functions. We will only understand the results if we know what they mean and how they are obtained. Therefore we will take a closer look at and analyze some of the scanning methods. After we have found out that our target is alive, we want to get a more accurate picture of the system. The information we need includes:

- Open ports and its services
- Service versions
- Information that the services provided
- Operating system

There are a total of 6 different states for a scanned port we can obtain:

|**State**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`open`|This indicates that the connection to the scanned port has been established. These connections can be **TCP connections**, **UDP datagrams** as well as **SCTP associations**.|
|`closed`|When the port is shown as closed, the TCP protocol indicates that the packet we received back contains an `RST` flag. This scanning method can also be used to determine if our target is alive or not.|
|`filtered`|Nmap cannot correctly identify whether the scanned port is open or closed because either no response is returned from the target for the port or we get an error code from the target.|
|`unfiltered`|This state of a port only occurs during the **TCP-ACK** scan and means that the port is accessible, but it cannot be determined whether it is open or closed.|
|`open\|filtered`|If we do not get a response for a specific port, `Nmap` will set it to that state. This indicates that a firewall or packet filter may protect the port.|
|`closed\|filtered`|This state only occurs in the **IP ID idle** scans and indicates that it was impossible to determine if the scanned port is closed or filtered by a firewall.|

 ## Discovering Open TCP Ports

By default, `Nmap` scans the top 1000 TCP ports with the SYN scan (`-sS`). This SYN scan is set only to default when we run it as root because of the socket permissions required to create raw TCP packets. Otherwise, the TCP scan (`-sT`) is performed by default. This means that if we do not define ports and scanning methods, these parameters are set automatically. We can define the ports one by one (`-p 22,25,80,139,445`), by range (`-p 22-445`), by top ports (`--top-ports=10`) from the `Nmap` database that have been signed as most frequent, by scanning all ports (`-p-`) but also by defining a fast port scan, which contains top 100 ports (`-F`).

|`-n`|Disables DNS resolution.|
|`--disable-arp-ping`|Disables ARP ping.|

---

We can see from the SENT line that we (`10.10.14.2`) sent a TCP packet with the `SYN` flag (`S`) to our target (`10.129.2.28`). In the next RCVD line, we can see that the target responds with a TCP packet containing the `RST` and `ACK` flags (`RA`). `RST` and `ACK` flags are used to acknowledge receipt of the TCP packet (`ACK`) and to end the TCP session (`RST`).


#### Connect Scan

The Nmap [TCP Connect Scan](https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-connect-scan.html) (`-sT`) uses the TCP three-way handshake to determine if a specific port on a target host is open or closed. The scan sends an `SYN` packet to the target port and waits for a response. It is considered open if the target port responds with an `SYN-ACK` packet and closed if it responds with an `RST` packet.

The `Connect` scan (also known as a full TCP connect scan) is highly accurate because it completes the three-way TCP handshake, allowing us to determine the exact state of a port (open, closed, or filtered). However, it is not the most stealthy. In fact, the Connect scan is one of the least stealthy techniques, as it fully establishes a connection, which creates logs on most systems and is easily detected by modern IDS/IPS solutions. That said, the Connect scan can still be useful in certain situations, particularly when accuracy is a priority, and the goal is to map the network without causing significant disruption to services. Since the scan fully establishes a TCP connection, it interacts cleanly with services, making it less likely to cause service errors or instability compared to more intrusive scans. While it is not the most stealthy method, it is sometimes considered a more "polite" scan because it behaves like a normal client connection, thus having minimal impact on the target services.

It is also useful when the target host has a personal firewall that drops incoming packets but allows outgoing packets. In this case, a Connect scan can bypass the firewall and accurately determine the state of the target ports. However, it is important to note that the Connect scan is slower than other types of scans because it requires the scanner to wait for a response from the target after each packet it sends, which could take some time if the target is busy or unresponsive.

Scans like the SYN scan (also known as a half-open scan) are generally considered more stealthy because they do not complete the full handshake, leaving the connection incomplete after sending the initial SYN packet. This minimizes the chance of triggering connection logs while still gathering port state information. Advanced IDS/IPS systems, however, have adapted to detect even these subtler techniques.


#### Connect Scan on TCP Port 443

## Discovering Open UDP Ports

Some system administrators sometimes forget to filter the UDP ports in addition to the TCP ones. Since `UDP` is a `stateless protocol` and does not require a three-way handshake like TCP. We do not receive any acknowledgment. Consequently, the timeout is much longer, making the whole `UDP scan` (`-sU`) much slower than the `TCP scan` (`-sS`).

Let's look at an example of what a UDP scan (`-sU`) can look like and what results it gives us.

# Saving the Results

---

## Different Formats

While we run various scans, we should always save the results. We can use these later to examine the differences between the different scanning methods we have used. `Nmap` can save the results in 3 different formats.

- Normal output (`-oN`) with the `.nmap` file extension
- Grepable output (`-oG`) with the `.gnmap` file extension
- XML output (`-oX`) with the `.xml` file extension


## Style sheets

With the XML output, we can easily create HTML reports that are easy to read, even for non-technical people. This is later very useful for documentation, as it presents our results in a detailed and clear way. To convert the stored results from XML format to HTML, we can use the tool `xsltproc`.

Saving the Results

```shell-session
0xM4llc10u5@htb[/htb]$ xsltproc target.xml -o target.html
```

If we now open the HTML file in our browser, we see a clear and structured presentation of our results.

# Service Enumeration

---

For us, it is essential to determine the application and its version as accurately as possible. We can use this information to scan for known vulnerabilities and analyze the source code for that version if we find it. An exact version number allows us to search for a more precise exploit that fits the service and the operating system of our target.

## Service Version Detection

It is recommended to perform a quick port scan first, which gives us a small overview of the available ports. This causes significantly less traffic, which is advantageous for us because otherwise we can be discovered and blocked by the security mechanisms. We can deal with these first and run a port scan in the background, which shows all open ports (`-p-`). We can use the version scan to scan the specific ports for services and their versions (`-sV`).

A full port scan takes quite a long time. To view the scan status, we can press the `[Space Bar]` during the scan, which will cause `Nmap` to show us the scan status.

We see that we can recognize the **Ubuntu** distribution of Linux by using the' banner' script. The `smtp-commands` script shows us which commands we can use by interacting with the target SMTP server. In this example, such information may help us to find out existing users on the target. `Nmap` also gives us the ability to scan our target with the aggressive option (`-A`). This scans the target with multiple options as service detection (`-sV`), OS detection (`-O`), traceroute (`--traceroute`), and with the default NSE scripts (`-sC`).

## Timeouts

When Nmap sends a packet, it takes some time (`Round-Trip-Time` - `RTT`) to receive a response from the scanned port. Generally, `Nmap` starts with a high timeout (`--min-RTT-timeout`) of 100ms. Let us look at an example by scanning the whole network with 256 hosts, including the top 100 ports.

#### Default Scan

Performance

```shell-session
0xM4llc10u5@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F

<SNIP>
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (10 hosts up) scanned in 39.44 seconds
```

#### Optimized RTT

Performance

```shell-session
0xM4llc10u5@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F --initial-rtt-timeout 50ms --max-rtt-timeout 100ms

<SNIP>
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (8 hosts up) scanned in 12.29 seconds
```

|**Scanning Options**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`10.129.2.0/24`|Scans the specified target network.|
|`-F`|Scans top 100 ports.|
|`--initial-rtt-timeout 50ms`|Sets the specified time value as initial RTT timeout.|
|`--max-rtt-timeout 100ms`|Sets the specified time value as maximum RTT timeout.|

When comparing the two scans, we can see that we found two hosts less with the optimized scan, but the scan took only a quarter of the time. From this, we can conclude that setting the initial RTT timeout (`--initial-rtt-timeout`) to too short a time period may cause us to overlook hosts.
For the RRT the friendly explanation is :
sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F --initial-rtt-timeout 50ms --max-rtt-timeout 100ms
 Explanation of Each Part
 sudo
Running as root allows Nmap to use raw sockets and send more efficient SYN scans, which are faster and more accurate.
 nmap
The network scanning tool used to discover hosts and services on a network.
 10.129.2.0/24
This is the target subnet, meaning you're scanning all 256 IP addresses from 10.129.2.0 to 10.129.2.255.
 -F
This tells Nmap to do a fast scan, meaning it only checks top 100 common ports instead of all 65535 ports.
 --initial-rtt-timeout 50ms
This sets the initial Round-Trip Time (RTT) timeout to 50 milliseconds. RTT is the time taken for a packet to go to the host and come back.
This tells Nmap to expect very fast responses, which is useful in low-latency networks like VPNs or LANs.
If a response doesn't come in 50ms, Nmap will retry with backoff (until max-rtt-timeout).
 --max-rtt-timeout 100ms
This sets the maximum timeout Nmap is allowed to wait for a response to 100 milliseconds.
If a host is very slow or the network is laggy, responses after 100ms will be ignored.
This helps speed up the scan but risks missing slow hosts or services.


## Max Retries

Another way to increase scan speed is by specifying the retry rate of sent packets (`--max-retries`). The default value is `10`, but we can reduce it to `0`. This means if Nmap does not receive a response for a port, it won't send any more packets to that port and will skip it.

#### Default Scan

Performance

```shell-session
0xM4llc10u5@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F | grep "/tcp" | wc -l

23
```

#### Reduced Retries

Performance

```shell-session
0xM4llc10u5@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F --max-retries 0 | grep "/tcp" | wc -l

21
```

|**Scanning Options**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`10.129.2.0/24`|Scans the specified target network.|
|`-F`|Scans top 100 ports.|
|`--max-retries 0`|Sets the number of retries that will be performed during the scan.|

Again, we recognize that accelerating can also have a negative effect on our results, which means we can overlook important information.

## Rates

### Rate-Based Scanning in Nmap?**

**Rate-based scanning** allows you to **manually control how fast Nmap sends packets** during a scan. This is useful in many scenarios where **performance, time, or control** matters.

During a white-box penetration test, we may get whitelisted for the security systems to check the systems in the network for vulnerabilities and not only test the protection measures. If we know the network bandwidth, we can work with the rate of packets sent, which significantly speeds up our scans with `Nmap`. When setting the minimum rate (`--min-rate <number>`) for sending packets, we tell `Nmap` to simultaneously send the specified number of packets. It will attempt to maintain the rate accordingly.

#### Default Scan

Performance

```shell-session
0xM4llc10u5@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F -oN tnet.default

<SNIP>
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (10 hosts up) scanned in 29.83 seconds
```

#### Optimized Scan

Performance

```shell-session
0xM4llc10u5@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F -oN tnet.minrate300 --min-rate 300

<SNIP>
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (10 hosts up) scanned in 8.67 seconds
```

|**Scanning Options**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`10.129.2.0/24`|Scans the specified target network.|
|`-F`|Scans top 100 ports.|
|`-oN tnet.minrate300`|Saves the results in normal formats, starting the specified file name.|
|`--min-rate 300`|Sets the minimum number of packets to be sent per second.|

#### Default Scan - Found Open Ports

Performance

```shell-session
0xM4llc10u5@htb[/htb]$ cat tnet.default | grep "/tcp" | wc -l

```

#### Optimized Scan - Found Open Ports

Performance

```shell-session
0xM4llc10u5@htb[/htb]$ cat tnet.minrate300 | grep "/tcp" | wc -l
```

## Firewalls

A firewall is a security measure against unauthorized connection attempts from external networks. Every firewall security system is based on a software component that monitors network traffic between the firewall and incoming data connections and decides how to handle the connection based on the rules that have been set. It checks whether individual network packets are being passed, ignored, or blocked. This mechanism is designed to prevent unwanted connections that could be potentially dangerous.

---

## IDS/IPS

Like the firewall, the intrusion detection system (`IDS`) and intrusion prevention system (`IPS`) are also software-based components. `IDS` scans the network for potential attacks, analyzes them, and reports any detected attacks. `IPS` complements `IDS` by taking specific defensive measures if a potential attack should have been detected. The analysis of such attacks is based on pattern matching and signatures. If specific patterns are detected, such as a service detection scan, `IPS` may prevent the pending connection attempts.

---

Nmap's TCP ACK scan (`-sA`) method is much harder to filter for firewalls and IDS/IPS systems than regular SYN (`-sS`) or Connect scans (`sT`) because they only send a TCP packet with only the `ACK` flag. When a port is closed or open, the host must respond with an `RST` flag. Unlike outgoing connections, all connection attempts (with the `SYN` flag) from external networks are usually blocked by firewalls. However, the packets with the `ACK` flag are often passed by the firewall because the firewall cannot determine whether the connection was first established from the external network or the internal network.

If we look at these scans, we will see how the results differ.

|`--packet-trace`|Shows all packets sent and received.|

Please pay attention to the RCVD packets and its set flag we receive from our target. With the SYN scan (`-sS`) our target tries to establish the TCP connection by sending a packet back with the SYN-ACK (`SA`) flags set and with the ACK scan (`-sA`) we get the `RST` flag because TCP port 22 is open. For the TCP port 25, we do not receive any packets back, which indicates that the packets will be dropped.

## Decoys

There are cases in which administrators block specific subnets from different regions in principle. This prevents any access to the target network. Another example is when IPS should block us. For this reason, the Decoy scanning method (`-D`) is the right choice. With this method, Nmap generates various random IP addresses inserted into the IP header to disguise the origin of the packet sent. With this method, we can generate random (`RND`) a specific number (for example: `5`) of IP addresses separated by a colon (`:`). Our real IP address is then randomly placed between the generated IP addresses. In the next example, our real IP address is therefore placed in the second position. Another critical point is that the decoys must be alive. Otherwise, the service on the target may be unreachable due to SYN-flooding security mechanisms.
